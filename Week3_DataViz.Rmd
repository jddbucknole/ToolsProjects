# Part 1 Movies!

```{r}
movie <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2018/2018-10-23/movie_profit.csv")
```

Let's take another look at the movie dataset from last week. Make a column chart showing the Top 10 movies by worldwide gross. Recall that column charts require an x (categories) and y (bar height) aesthetic.  The bars should represent the respective worldwide gross of the movie *and be ordered by from largest to smallest*.  Note: this is handled by reordering factors (arrange will not be enough!). There is a function to assist in the `forcats` package that is included in `tidyverse`.  A simple google search should help.

Make use of the coord_flip() layer to make the labels readable and color code the bars (not just the outlines of the bars!) by the MPAA rating of the movie.  Finish with a short sentence describing what you see.

```{r top10movies}
deleteme <- 0
```

# Part 2 Babynames

## Group name popularity

Create a graph showing the popularity of your group members first names over time. Make sure to account for the correct sex.

Here is an example for the Beatles. What name benefited from the appearance?

```{r groupnames}
deleteme <- 0
```


## Most common names each year separated by sex

How has the most common name (by percentage of a sex) changed over time? In addition, what are those 'common' names?  For this prompt, there will be some learning via exploration.  Create the following plot: 

<center> <img src="https://github.com/jddbucknole/ToolsProjects/blob/main/Rplot01.png?raw=true">

For your solution, you will need to research the scales package (to get the labels on the y axis to be percents) and the ggrepel packages to have non-overlapping labels.  Don't neglect the labels and the fact that the sex variable has been recoded.

Obviously, this is still a cluttered graph.  If you can think of a way to make it cleaner, please do.  My initial impression is only to show the name when the name changes, but this may be difficult.  Put your code below.  You can accomplish this with one piped series of commands, but that isn't necessary.

```{r}
deleteme <- 0
```

There is a weird spike with a new woman's name taking over the top spot around 1946.  What is that name and why did it spike?
